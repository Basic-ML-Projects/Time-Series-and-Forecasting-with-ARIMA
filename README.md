# Time-Series-and-Forecasting-with-ARIMA
A hands on implementation of the ARIMA model

When looking through notebook, it is mentioned that ARIMA was not the best model to use given the data used. However, this repository was meant to show how an ARIMA could be used for a time series anaylsis and forecasting type of situation. The purpose of this project was truly educational, but a more hardcore forecasting project that will focus more on results rather than educational will be implemeneted soon.
